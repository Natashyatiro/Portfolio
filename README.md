# [Automatic Credit Approval using Maching Learning](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Automating-Credit-Approval)
* Created a tool that predict loan amount and customer’s default based on customer’s age and income to help bank in automating their credit approval process.
*	Optimized and compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBoost, MLP Regressor, CNN, Random Forest Regressor Optimization to predict loan amount and to reach the best model using Python and Orange.
*	Optimized and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBoost, MLP Classifier, CNN (Keras Sequential) with Keras Tuner to predict loan amount and to reach the best model using Python and Orange.
*	The best model performance is by Regressor Optimization for Random Forest with 2456.62 RMSE in loan amount prediction, and Gradient Boosting with 85.88% accuracy in default prediction.
* Deployed the model to the cloud and built a client facing API using flask.

# [Fetal Heart Health Condition Classification in R](https://github.com/Natashyatiro/Fetal-Heart-Health-Condition-Classification-)
*	Created a tool that classifies fetal heart health conditions (normal, suspicious, pathologic) based on cardiotocography data.
*	Optimized and compared e Logistic Regression for Multicategory Y, CART, and Random Forest in R to reach the best model.
* Random Forest performed best out of three with highest accuracy (99.6%) with both a low specificity and a low fall-out value. Not to mention, Random Forest in this study also outperformed models from previous research.
